<h1> Reflection </h1>
<h3> The First Quarter </h3>
<pre>
<p>
 	As the first quarter closes, we reflect on our triumphs and losses.
This quarter has been great so far. I've accomplished much and am excited to
proceed to the next quarter.

	Regrets, I've had a few. I know that I could have done much better 
in various parts. Like my notes in AP and Science. My grades will likely not 
be the best.

	But isn't that part of the thrill? To fail over and over again, but 
eventually succeeding?
